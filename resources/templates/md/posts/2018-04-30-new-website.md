I've launched my personal website on jeffterrell.tech. It's powered by the
[Cryogen static site generator](http://cryogenweb.org/), written in
[Clojure](https://clojure.org/), and hosted for free without ads by
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). (Thanks, everybody!)

I've moved the posts I wrote for the (now defunct) Altometrics Blog here. I
hope soon to be linking to more of the content I've created over the past
couple of years, like Medium posts and YouTube videos, so stay tuned. Until
then, you can [read about this website](/pages/about).
