I have an exciting new job lined up on July 1
(~~stay tuned for that announcement~~
update: see announcement [here](../2018-03-03-new-job/)), but I have about a
month and a half free between now and then.  Anybody have a project they could
use my help on? I specialize in Clojure\[script\], data analytics and
visualization, and Javascript, and I've been known to work on Rails and other
projects as well. You can find my r&eacute;sum&eacute; [here](/img/résumé.pdf)
and my LinkedIn Profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreyterrell/).

Here's a summary of my skills:

> I am a versatile programmer with a deep bag of tricks and an eye towards
> beautiful, maintainable code.  I learn quickly and communicate well; I am
> disciplined and responsible; and I will be the sort of freelance programmer
> you would hire again and again.

And here's a recommendation, from former client Peter Nixey, YCombinator S07
alumnus, then CEO and founder of HiringBuddy.com:

> Jeff has all of the characteristics that one could look or hope for in a
> developer.  Most valuable of all are his excellent communication skills and
> his diligence:  he documents his work well, keeps to meetings and  is
> extremely  good  at  articulating  both  progress  and  challenges.   As  a
> developer  he  is  highly intelligent, calm, reliable, diligent hard working
> and honest.  If he doesn’t know something he will quickly and efficiently
> come up to speed on it and has good self-awareness about what time he spends
> developing and what time he spends learning.  I thoroughly recommend working
> with Jeff and have very much enjoyed our interactions.
