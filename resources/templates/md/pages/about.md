## About Jeff Terrell

Currently a software craftsman at [RoleModel Software](https://www.rolemodelsoftware.com/). Soon to be the UNC Computer Science Department's Professor of the Practice (starting summer 2018). I got my Ph.D. from the same department in 2009, tried (and failed) to commercialize my research, and joined the great folks at RoleModel in 2016.

I live on a humble homestead on a few acres, north of Durham, NC, with my wife, three kiddos, loyal mutt, two goats, and a variable number of chickens.
