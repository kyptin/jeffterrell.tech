## About Jeff Terrell

Currently (as of summer 2018) the Professor of the Practice of Computer Science at UNC. Previously I was a software craftsman at [RoleModel Software](https://www.rolemodelsoftware.com/). I got my Ph.D. from [CS@UNC](https://cs.unc.edu) in 2009, tried (and failed) to commercialize my research, and joined the great folks at RoleModel in 2016.

I live on a humble homestead on a few acres, north of Durham, NC, with my wife, three kiddos, loyal mutt, two goats, and a variable number of chickens.
